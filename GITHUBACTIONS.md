# GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline)

## Create workflow

- Create folder `.github/workflows` in the root of your project
- Make a `tests.yml` file

```yml
name: Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    types: [opened, synchronize]

          cd ../server

          bun run build
          bun run test:cicd &
          sleep 5

      - name: Run e2e tests
        run: |
          cd e2e-tests
          bun run test:cicd --reporter=html

        if: ${{ !cancelled() }}

```

This requires that you have some tests done and installed playwright etc.

## Protect the branch in GitHub

- Go to your branch settings -> Branches -> Add rule
- _Branch name pattern_: `main`
- Check these boxes on _Protect matching branches_ -> `Require a pull request before merging`, `Require approvals`, `Require status checks to pass before merging`, `Require branches to be up to date before merging`
- Search for `Backend Tests`, `Frontend Tests`, `e2e-tests` for the status checks and Save changes
- Create `pre-push` file in `.git/hooks` folder in the root of your repository:

```
#!/bin/bash
protected_branch="main"
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

if [ "$current_branch" = "$protected_branch" ]; then
  echo "ðŸš¨ Direct pushes to '$protected_branch' are not allowed! Please create a pull request."
  exit 1
fi
```

- `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push` to make it executable
  This makes sure that you can't push directly in the main branch.

- Also create `pre-commit` file in the `.git/hooks` folder in the root of your repository:

```
#!/bin/bash

protected_branch="main"
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

if [ "$current_branch" = "$protected_branch" ]; then
  if ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
    echo "ðŸš¨ Staged changes are not allowed on the '$protected_branch' branch!"
    echo "Unstaging files..."
    # Unstage all files
    git reset
    exit 1
  fi
fi


```

- `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit` to make it executable
  This prevents commiting files on the main branch
